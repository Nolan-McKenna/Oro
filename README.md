# Oro Programming Language

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Oro is currently in early development. Many features are still being implemented.

Oro is an open-source, interpreted programming language designed to simplify and optimize text processing. Many programming languages struggle with efficient, large-scale text manipulation, especially when dealing with multiple file formats. Oro seeks to address this by providing a specialized language focused on intuitive text processing capabilities.
